# O.D.I.N (Ocular Detection Instead of Noise)

## [Matrix Creator](https://matrix-io.github.io/matrix-documentation/matrix-creator/overview/)
The MATRIX Creator is a hatter for the raspberry pi featureing 11 different types of sensors including an array of 8 microphones. 

## [Odin Web](https://github.com/introlab/odas/wiki)
ODAS (Open embeddeD Audition system), performs sound source localization, tracking, separation and post-filtering. Data is then piped into an advanced electron App called Odin Web, with helpful vizualizations about the data, as well as a useful server for offloading data to other apps (such as the AR Directional Display app).

## [IBM MAX Audio Classifier](https://developer.ibm.com/exchanges/models/all/max-audio-classifier/)
IBM MAX Audio Classifier is used to classify sound bites. The model supports 527 different classes, and was trained on the Google AudioSet.

## Augmented Reality Directional Display
Using microphone wavelet data from the MATRIX Creator, and ARCore, The Augmented Reality Directional Display is able to allow users to view exactly which direction their sound is coming from.
